                "description": "This is a new product preorder sale.The expected shipping time for the Blood Angels Sanguinius, Primarch of the IXth Legion figure is from December 2024. Any other Warhammer Merch items ordered in the same transaction will ship as normal.\nThis product will ship from the UK (UK Tax Included). Buy with confidence from the official Warhammer Merchandise Store and guarantee your order.\nBy pre-ordering Sanguinius, you will also receive a free exclusive premium T Shirt featuring Sanguinius. This T Shirt is only available as part of this preorder and will never be on-sale again. Ensure you choose your preferred size when placing your pre-order.\nThe free exclusive t shirt has zero monetary value, and cannot be refunded.\nOften considered to be the greatest of his kin, Sanguinius is a peerless warrior, masterful strategist and beloved hero of the Imperium. Among the primarchs, there were few who would speak ill of him, with even grim figures such as Perturabo and Ferrus Manus offering grudging praise of their winged brother.Many among that legendary brotherhood were surprised to find that the Emperor named Horus as Warmaster, rather than choosing Sanguinius, and those who survived the Age of Darkness have been known to speculate that this was their father’s great mistake. For even as the wars of the Horus Heresy tore the Imperium apart and set even the noblest of his brothers on dark paths, Sanguinius remained untarnished and resolute, a beacon of hope that outshone even the darkness of that age.\nThis highly detailed 1/18 scale Warhammer The Horus Heresy Blood Angels action figure features 32 points of articulation and comes with additional interchangeable parts.\nSpecs:\n\n- 18.8cm Tall  (h18.8cm, w9.3cm, d8.7cm)\n- Wingspan 33.5cm\n- 1/18 Scale- Made of plastic- Packaging: (h25cm, w22cm, d14.5cm)- Packaging Weight: 1300g\n\n\n\nThe manufacturers recommended age for this product is 15+.\n\n\nWarning!

It was Dorn and his Imperial Fists who formed the heart of the Imperial defence on Terra - and without their sacrifices, all might have been lost.\nAs a 1/18th scale action figure, Rogal Dorn is clad in the iconic Auric Armour, said to be formed from the same auric-adamantium alloy as the armour of the Emperor himself. To battle the enemies of Mankind, he bears the legendary chainblade Storm's Teeth and a masterwork bolter known as The Voice of Terra.\nSpecs:\n- 18cm Tall  (h18cm, w10.5cm, d7.2cm)- 1/18 Scale - Made of plastic- Based on Warhammer The Horus Heresy- Packaging: h25cm, w22cm, d10cm- Packaging Weight: 1000g\nThe manufacturers recommended age for this product is 15+.\nWarning!
