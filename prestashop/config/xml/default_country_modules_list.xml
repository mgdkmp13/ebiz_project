Capitalize on the key reassurance factor: video customer review]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[rec.reviews&nbsp;is a&nbsp;fully automated&nbsp;service that lets you easily collect&nbsp;your customers&#39; video reviews&nbsp;and publish them, once validated, on your online store and YouTube channel.&nbsp;VIDEO: A KEY FACTOR IN REASSURING CUSTOMERS&nbsp;The importance of customer reviews has long since been proven. We know that&nbsp;more than 9 out of 10 consumers consult reviews before purchasing, seeking reassurance on the conformity and characteristics of the desired product. Indeed, the best way to be convinced is to ask another buyer. Today, customer experience is much more important than advertising and all those marketing strategies that lack authenticity.&nbsp;Nowadays, however, and particularly with the development of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligences accessible to all, fake text reviews are becoming more and more common. Internet users are less and less fooled and tend not to trust what they read. On the other hand,&nbsp;videos are booming,&nbsp;especially those in which consumers share their feelings about a product.&nbsp;84% of customers&nbsp;claim to have made a purchasing decision&nbsp;after watching a video.&nbsp;Whereas behind a text review there is always the doubt of the source and the veracity of the words,&nbsp;seeing a real person&nbsp;talk about his experience makes the testimonial much more authentic and credible, and proves to be formidably effective in convincing web users in their purchasing decision. Moreover, it allows you to view the object from every angle, and to reassure yourself about key product characteristics such as color or size, as if you were in a physical store.&nbsp;Conversions are thus greatly facilitated,&nbsp;and the number of product returns due to non-conformity with the description is also inevitably reduced.&nbsp;MAKE YOUR CUSTOMERS YOUR BEST AMBASSADORS&nbsp;With&nbsp;rec.reviews&nbsp;you enable your visitors&nbsp;to be reassured&nbsp;about the product they want to buy, by viewing, directly on your site, the video reviews of&nbsp;real&nbsp;customers who have the same needs and expectations as they do, and who share their feelings about the product they&#39;ve ordered. Convincing power guaranteed.&nbsp;This technique, which combines&nbsp;authenticity, customer feedback and mutual support, is known as &quot;User Generated Content&quot;:&nbsp;by sharing their experience in a natural and spontaneous way&nbsp;within a short video, your own customers create quality content on your site and help future buyers. They become your best ambassadors, whether on your online store or on social networks, and help create a community around your products. This is an excellent opportunity to&nbsp;increase your conversion rate, generate engagement and build customer loyalty.&nbsp;Still little used, displaying video customer reviews on your store will also help you stand out from the competition. By offering an&nbsp;original&nbsp;shopping experience based on&nbsp;mutual assistance&nbsp;between your customers and the collection of video reviews, you&#39;ll arouse the interest of Internet users. Moreover, by letting your customers testify publicly on video,&nbsp;you show that you&#39;re not cheating and that you offer quality.&nbsp;Video reviews are therefore a real way of&nbsp;increasing your traffic.&nbsp;IMPROVE YOUR SEO&nbsp;Finally, as video is the medium that captures the most attention, by adding videos to your pages your visitors will spend&nbsp;more time on your site,&nbsp;which will&nbsp;improve your SEO.&nbsp;Indeed, Google favorably ranks pages on which a significant amount of time is spent. Given that a user spends on average&nbsp;88% more time on a page containing a video,&nbsp;this type of media, therefore,&nbsp;is essential for the SEO&nbsp;of your store.&nbsp;REC.REVIEWS A FULLY AUTOMATED SERVICE&nbsp;The principle is very simple:&nbsp;once a customer has purchased a product, he receives an e-mail&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;inviting him to click on a link to record his opinion in a short video (30 seconds maximum). He can re-watch the video and repeat the recording as many times as he wants. He is also invited to leave a rating between 1 and 5 for the product. The video is then made available to you on a dedicated dashboard and, if you validate it, it is&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;posted on the corresponding product page. But that&#39;s not all! You can also easily share the video review on your YouTube channel.&nbsp;rec.reviews takes care of&nbsp;the video editing&nbsp;for you, with your store logo and essential customer authentication information (order date, review recording date, product rating, etc.), and stores the video on a dedicated space. So you don&#39;t have to worry about managing your bandwidth, traffic or disk space.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[front_office_features]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.6]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.4.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.2.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[0]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[0]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[0]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1572960-pprod/recreviews-video-product-review.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1572960-pbig/recreviews-video-product-review.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[90502]]></id><name><![CDATA[ldinstagramslider]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Instagram feed Slider - Show your Instagram feed]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Social Widgets]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[This module for Prestashop displays the latest Instagram posts with over 450 design combinations.

Here are some of these potential benefits:Customer base expansion: By accepting payments in SEPA and cryptocurrencies, merchants can attract customers who prefer to use digital currencies to make online purchases. This can help expand the potential customer base and increase sales.Reduced transaction fees: Cryptocurrency payments typically involve lower transaction fees than traditional credit card or bank transfer payments. Merchants can therefore save money on transaction fees and increase their profit margin.Increased security: Cryptocurrency payments are encrypted and anonymous, which can help reduce the risks of fraud and theft of personal information. In addition, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, making it difficult for customers to dispute transactions after they have been made.Easier international transactions: Cryptocurrency payments are not subject to foreign exchange restrictions or conversion fees, making international transactions easier for both merchants and customers.Innovative image: Integrating cryptocurrency payment solutions can give merchants an innovative and forward-thinking image, which can help improve their reputation and positioning in the market.Commissions: The merchant has the possibility to set the coefficient of his commissions between 1% and 5%]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[]]></tab><version><![CDATA[2.0.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.6.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.2.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[0]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[0]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[0]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Official Partner"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/ps-official-partner.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1583820-pprod/youpay-is-an-iban-account-credit-card-payment.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1583820-pbig/youpay-is-an-iban-account-credit-card-payment.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[91101]]></id><name><![CDATA[aplaceautocomplete]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[APlace.io - Address Autocomplete]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Registration & Ordering Process]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Use the APlace.io service to add address autocompletion in your store&#39;s order form]]></description><author><![CDATA[PrestaShop Partners]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/registration-ordering-process/91101-aplaceio-address-autocomplete.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/91101.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Use the APlace.io service to add address autocompletion in your store&#39;s order form.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Introducing APlace.io: Enhance Your Applications with Powerful Tools&nbsp;APlace.io is a service that empowers developers to seamlessly integrate robust geolocation tools into their applications.

And we know that your time is precious. That&#39;s why we&#39;re providing you with an e-commerce co-pilot that will help you create the best possible, SEO-optimized descriptions in the shortest possible time.&nbsp;Our &quot;E-commerce Copilot&quot; module lets you use the power of GPT-4 artificial intelligence to generate your product and category descriptions, as well as the content of your CMS pages. Don&#39;t spend hours manually writing your product descriptions: team up with a qualified partner and save time every day!&nbsp;SAVE TIME EVERY DAY&nbsp;The module installs&nbsp;an e-commerce content writing wizard&nbsp;on your PrestaShop store, saving you time every day: choose the type of content you want to write (short, long or meta description of a product or category, CMS page content), ask the AI to generate it, proofread it, modify it if necessary, then save! In just a few clicks, you&#39;ll have a complete, SEO-optimized text with minimum effort. In the same way, you can ask GPT-4 to translate content into any of your store&#39;s languages.We&#39;ve already drawn up prompts for you to send to GPT-4, so that you can start using the module as soon as it&#39;s installed, and save time in the process. However, if for any reason you&#39;d like to write your own prompts, you can! A tab in the module configuration is dedicated to customizing prompts.Finally, there&#39;s no need to go outside the product creation forms to use AI: we&#39;ve integrated the tool for generating and translating product descriptions directly within the forms. This allows you to enlist the help of your co-pilot directly during the product creation process! You can also call on your e-commerce assistant at any time, wherever you are in the back office of your PrestaShop store. The AI can be accessed directly via a menu section in your PrestaShop store.&nbsp;KEEP CONTROL OVER THE QUALITY OF YOUR CONTENT&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence is powerful, but it can&#39;t completely replace you. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve made it a point of honor to let you control the content generated, ensuring that the text is consistent and perfectly reflects your vision and the style of your store. Once your approval has been obtained, the module automatically saves the new texts or translations.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[quick_bulk_update]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.4]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.2.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[0]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[0]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[0]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1602584-pprod/ecommerce-copilot-generate-translate-chatgpt-gpt-4.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1602584-pbig/ecommerce-copilot-generate-translate-chatgpt-gpt-4.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[92292]]></id><name><![CDATA[smartargetsocialproofsales]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Social Proof Sales]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Promotions & Gifts]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Show notifications of previous sales on your website to get more trust by new and existing customers]]></description><author><![CDATA[PrestaShop Partners]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/promotions-gifts/92292-social-proof-sales.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/92292.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Show notifications of previous sales on your website to get more trust by new and existing customers.

Pay for the module in instalments and reap the benefits of Google advertising right away, by focusing on optimizing your Google Ads.&nbsp;BOOST YOUR VISIBILITY AND TRAFFIC&nbsp;Showcase your products on&nbsp;all the channels of Google Ads Shopping campaigns&nbsp;and develop your visibility without further delay. Make yourself known internationally in an accelerated way and get thousands of new highly qualified visitors to your shop.&nbsp;With over a decade of success, our&nbsp;Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping)&nbsp;module is by far the most robust and complete Google Shopping module on the market. Far ahead of its competitors, our module is recommended by the largest e-commerce agencies, on the one hand for its simplicity of configuration and on the other hand for the guarantee of exporting to Google Merchant Center a high quality data feed that meets all Google&#39;s requirements.&nbsp;The module has been developed to allow you to create, step by step, a product data feed for which&nbsp;you are in control of the information. We have included, throughout the configuration,&nbsp;links to a precise and complete documentation&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Google&#39;s official regulations. You quickly get a clear product data file that you can export to Google Merchant Center and which you can schedule to be updated automatically at the desired frequency.&nbsp;Advertise your products for free:&nbsp;with a quality product data feed, you have the ability to display&nbsp;for free&nbsp;your products on Google Shopping, and other compatible Google properties, in &quot;free product listings&quot;. Thanks to our module, which meets all Google requirements for quality and completeness of product data, you are sure to meet all eligibility criteria to use this feature, so don&#39;t hesitate any longer!&nbsp;Any questions? Our support department has&nbsp;many years of experience and a high level of expertise regarding the rather strict constraints and demands of Google Merchant Center,&nbsp;and will be happy to answer your questions in the best possible way!&nbsp;EVEN MORE DATA CONTROL WITH ADVANCED PLAN&nbsp;Go even further with the &quot;Advanced&quot; plan:&nbsp;In addition to the multiple possibilities of configuring your feed that the Classical plan already offers, you will be able to refine the choice of products or product combinations to be exported thanks to the setting up of extremely precise and personalized exclusion rules.&nbsp;Thanks to the advanced assignation of custom labels, you will also have the ability to segment your product catalog and therefore organize your ads according to the seasonality of your products, their popularity, or the margin you can apply to them. This allows you to control your budget by offering the right products at the right time and optimize your return on investment.&nbsp;In Shopping ads, the display of stars reflecting the rating of items undoubtedly gives more attractiveness to products.The Advanced plan allows you&nbsp;to export your customers&#39; product reviews(*)&nbsp;and to participate in the &quot;Product Ratings&quot; program. The reviews are collected and compiled with reviews of the same products from other sources&nbsp;(including &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot;, review aggregators, ...).&nbsp;If conditions are met, the average product rating can then be displayed in your ads and free product listings in the form of one to five stars.&nbsp;What better to encourage people to click and buy than a discount voucher featured in your ad? Thanks to Advanced plan, you can filter and&nbsp;export the promotional codes&nbsp;to attach to your ads. This plan also enables you to export&nbsp;a local inventory feed of your products,&nbsp;so that you can tell a web user that the product he is searching for on Google is available at the same time in one of your nearby stores.&nbsp;Finally, the Advanced plan integrates the &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; feature. This is&nbsp;a free service&nbsp;that lets you collect, via Google,&nbsp;your customers&#39; reviews about their shopping experience.&nbsp;If they agree to participate, they receive an email a few days after receiving their order, asking them to rate their experience between 1 and 5 stars and to leave a comment if they wish. Once a certain number of ratings have been collected, through &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; and third-party rating partners, Google can include this seller rating in your text ads and free listings. You can also display it on your store, as part of a &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; badge. Through &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot;, Google can also collect&nbsp;your customers&#39; reviews of products ordered from your online store&nbsp;and compile them with those sent through your product review feed, for example (see the &quot;product ratings feed&quot; feature of the module).&nbsp;(*)See conditions in the &quot;Features&quot; section&nbsp;WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF SUBSCRIPTION?&nbsp;Thanks to subscription, you benefit from all the features of our best-selling &quot;Google Merchant Center&quot; module, at a lower cost. You pay just &euro;10.99 per month, and with the savings you can invest as much as possible in optimizing your ads on Google and its network. You can reap the benefits of this increased visibility very quickly.&nbsp;Would you like to try out the features of the Pro version of Google Merchant Center, but don&#39;t yet have the budget?

But it doesn&#39;t stop at language and currency! All data with different values in other countries will automatically adapt to the locality (availability, sizes, delivery costs, etc.).&nbsp;By default, the module (standard or PRO version) offers you all possible &quot;Country/Language/Currency&quot; combinations based on the native localization packs installed on your PrestaShop store. However,&nbsp;with this PRO version&nbsp;you can&nbsp;create additional feeds&nbsp;corresponding to combinations not offered by the module.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[social_networks]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.2]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.2.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[0]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[0]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[0]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1651051-pprod/facebook-dynamic-ads-pixel-pro-by-subscription.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1651051-pbig/facebook-dynamic-ads-pixel-pro-by-subscription.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[94746]]></id><name><![CDATA[amazonsaas]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Amazon Marketplace Plus]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Marketplaces]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Best solution to export products on Amazon, import and manage orders]]></description><author><![CDATA[Common-Services]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplaces/94746-amazon-marketplace-plus.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/94746.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Best solution to export products on Amazon, import and manage orders.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[You can easily integrate your PrestaShop store to the world&rsquo;s top marketplace Amazon and significantly increase your sales.
